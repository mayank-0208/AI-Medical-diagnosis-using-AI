# Disease Prediction using Machine Learning ⚕️
This project is an AI-powered disease prediction system built using Streamlit for the front-end and machine learning models trained on medical datasets. It helps predict diseases such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson’s, Lung Cancer, and Hypo-Thyroid based on user input.

Features
✅ User-friendly UI – Built with Streamlit, featuring a clean and intuitive design.
✅ Multiple Disease Predictions – Supports Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson’s, Lung Cancer, and Hypo-Thyroid predictions.
✅ AI-powered Diagnosis – Uses Machine Learning (ML) models trained on medical data.
✅ Secure Cloud Storage – Ensures patient data privacy and encryption.

Tech Stack 🛠️
🔹 Front-End (User Interface)
Streamlit – Web framework for building the UI.
Python – Programming language used for backend logic.
🔹 Machine Learning Models
Scikit-Learn – Used for training classification models.
TensorFlow/Keras (Optional) – For deep learning models.
🔹 Backend & Data Storage
Pickle (.sav files) – Used to load trained models.
SQL / Firebase (Optional) – Cloud storage for medical records.

How It Works 🤖
1️⃣ Select a disease from the dropdown menu.
2️⃣ Enter medical details (e.g., symptoms, test results, lifestyle factors).
3️⃣ Click the prediction button to get AI-generated results.
4️⃣ The system displays whether the person has or does not have the disease.

Future Improvements 🚀
Expand dataset to improve accuracy.
Integrate a chatbot for interactive symptom checking.
Add medical image analysis using CNNs for X-ray/MRI predictions.
Implement a cloud database for secure data storage.
